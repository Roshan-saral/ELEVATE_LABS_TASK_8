A container packages an application along with all its dependencies, libraries, and configuration files into a single lightweight unit. It ensures that the app runs consistently across different environments — from development to production. Containers are isolated from the host system, making them secure and portable. They start quickly, use fewer resources than virtual machines, and are ideal for deploying microservices and scalable cloud-native applications.
